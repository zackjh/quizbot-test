    <h1>WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2021-2024</h1>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <h2>1. Spirit of the Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li id="1.1">
        1.1. Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated sport. All players are
        responsible for administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies
        upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play
        on every player.
      </li>
      <li id="1.2">
        1.2. It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules;
        thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent breaches, but rather a
        method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most
        likely have occurred had there been no breach.
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.2.1. If there is a deliberate or egregious breach of the rules or
            Spirit of the Game, the captains should discuss this and determine
            an appropriate outcome, even if that outcome is not in accordance
            with a specific rule.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li id="1.3">
        1.3. Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as
        referees in any arbitration between teams. Players must:
        <ul>
          <li id="1.3.2">1.3.1. know the rules;</li>
          <li id="1.3.3">1.3.2. be fair-minded and objective;</li>
          <li id="1.3.3">1.3.3. be truthful;</li>
          <li id="1.3.4">1.3.4. explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;</li>
          <li id="1.3.5">1.3.5. allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;</li>
          <li id="1.3.6">1.3.6. consider their opponent’s viewpoint;</li>
          <li id="1.3.7">
            1.3.7. use respectful words and body language with consideration of
            potential cultural differences;
          </li>
          <li id="1.3.8">
            1.3.8. resulve disputes as quickly as possible, using respectful
            language;
          </li>
          <li id="1.3.9">
            1.3.9. make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game; and
          </li>
          <li id="1.3.10">
            1.3.10. only make a call where a breach is significant enough to
            make a difference to the outcome of the action.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li id="1.4">
        1.4. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice
        the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules
        of the game, player safety or the basic joy of play.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.5. The fullowing actions are examples of good Spirit:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.5.1. retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was
            correct;
          </li>
          <li>
            1.5.2. checking in with an opponent on the sideline after a
            contentious interaction;
          </li>
          <li>1.5.3. complimenting an opponent for good play or Spirit;</li>
          <li>1.5.4. introducing yourself to your opponent; and</li>
          <li>1.5.5. reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        1.6. The fullowing actions are clear viulations of the Spirit of the
        Game and must be avoided:
        <ul>
          <li>1.6.1. dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;</li>
          <li>
            1.6.2. intentional fouling or other intentional rule breaches;
          </li>
          <li>1.6.3. taunting or intimidating opposing players;</li>
          <li>1.6.4. celebrating disrespectfully after scoring;</li>
          <li>1.6.5. making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s call;</li>
          <li>1.6.6. calling for a pass from an opposition player; and</li>
          <li>1.6.7. other win-at-all-costs behaviour.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        1.7. Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.7.1. take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and
            good Spirit;
          </li>
          <li>1.7.2. discipline team-mates who display poor Spirit;</li>
          <li>
            1.7.3. provide constructive feedback to other teams about what they
            are doing well and/or how to improve their adherence to the Spirit
            of the Game; and
          </li>
          <li>
            1.7.4. call a Spirit Stoppage to address Spirit issues, as
            appropriate.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        1.8. In the case where a novice player is invulved in a breach and does
        not know the rules, experienced players should assist to explain the
        breach.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.9. An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides
        on-field arbitration, may supervise games invulving beginners or younger
        players.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.10. Calls should be discussed by the players directly invulved in the
        play, and by players who had the best perspective:
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.10.1. If a player who was not directly invulved believes that a
            team-mate has made an incorrect call, or caused a foul or viulation,
            they should inform their team-mate.
          </li>
          <li>
            1.10.2. Non-Players, apart from the captains, should refrain from
            getting invulved. However players may seek other peoples'
            perspectives to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the
            appropriate call.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        1.11. Players and captains are sulely responsible for making and
        resulving all calls.
      </li>
      <li>
        1.12. If, after discussion, players cannot agree, or it is not clear and
        obvious:
        <ul>
          <li>1.12.1. what occurred in a play, or</li>
          <li>1.12.2. what would most likely have occurred in a play,</li>
        </ul>
        the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. Playing Field</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2.1. The playing field is a rectangular area with dimensions and zones
        as shown on Figure 1 (see above) and should be essentially flat, free of
        obstructions, and afford reasonable player safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.2. The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two
        (2) sidelines along the length and two (2) endlines along the width.
      </li>
      <li>2.3. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.</li>
      <li>
        2.4. The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from
        the end zones and are part of the central zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.5. The brick marks are the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1)
        metre lines in the central zone, located a distance equal to the length
        of the end zone away from each goal line, midway between the sidelines.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.6. Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones)
        mark the corners of the central zone and the end zones.
      </li>
      <li>
        2.7. The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear
        of movable objects. If play is obstructed by non-players or objects
        within three (3) metres of the perimeter line, any obstructed player or
        thrower in possession may call “Violation”.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3.1. Any flying disc acceptable to both captains may be used.</li>
      <li>
        3.2. WFDF may maintain a list of approved discs recommended for use.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.3. Each player must wear a uniform that distinguishes their team.
      </li>
      <li>
        3.4. No player may wear items of clothing or equipment that reasonably
        could harm the wearer or other players, or impede an opponent's ability
        to play.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Point, Goal and Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4.1. A game consists of a number of points. Each point ends with the
        scoring of a goal.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.2. A game is finished and won by the first team to score fifteen (15)
        goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.3. A game is separated into two (2) periods of play, called halves.
        Half time occurs when a team first scores eight (8) goals.
      </li>
      <li>4.4. The first point of each half starts when the half starts.</li>
      <li>
        4.5. After a goal is scored, and the game has not been won or half time
        has not been reached:
        <ul>
          <li>4.5.1. the next point starts immediately;</li>
          <li>
            4.5.2. the teams switch the end zone that they are defending; and
          </li>
          <li>4.5.3. the team that scored becomes defence and pulls next.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Teams</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        5.1. Each team will put a maximum of seven (7) players and a minimum of
        five (5) players on the field during each point.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.2. Each team must designate a captain and a spirit captain to
        represent the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        5.3. A team may make unlimited substitutions after a goal is scored and
        before their team signals readiness for the pull.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Starting a Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        6.1. Representatives of the two teams fairly determine which team first
        chooses either:
        <ul>
          <li>6.1.1. whether to receive or throw the initial pull; or</li>
          <li>6.1.2. which end zone they will initially defend.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>6.2. The other team is given the remaining choice.</li>
      <li>
        6.3. At the start of the second half, these initial selections are
        switched.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. The Pull</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        7.1. At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, play
        commences with a throw by the defence, called a "pull".
        <ul>
          <li>
            7.1.1. Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        7.2. The pull may be made only after both teams have signalled their
        readiness by having the puller and a player on offence raise a hand
        above their head.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.3. After signalling readiness all offensive players must stand with
        one foot on their defending goal line without changing location relative
        to one another until the pull is released.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.4. After signalling readiness all defensive players must keep their
        feet entirely behind the vertical plane of the goal line until the pull
        is released.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.5. If a team breaches 7.3 or 7.4 the opposing team may call a
        violation (“offside”). This must be called before the offence touches
        the disc (7.8 still applies).
        <ul>
          <li>
            7.5.1. If the defence chooses to call offside, the thrower must
            establish a pivot point as per 7.9, 7.10, 7.11, or 7.12 and then
            play restarts as soon as possible as if a time-out had been called
            at that location.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.5.2. If the offence chooses to call offside, they must let the
            disc hit the ground untouched and then resume play as if a brick has
            been called (no check is required).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        7.6. As soon as the disc is released, all players may move in any
        direction.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.7. No player on the defensive team may touch the disc after a pull
        until a member of the offensive team contacts the disc or the disc hits
        the ground.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.8. If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the
        disc before it hits the ground, and the offensive team fails to
        subsequently establish possession, that is a turnover (a “dropped
        pull”).
      </li>
      <li>
        7.9. If an offensive player catches the pull and subsequently
        establishes possession, they must establish a pivot point at the
        location on the playing field nearest to where possession is
        established, even if that pivot point is in their defending end zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.10. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes
        out-of-bounds, the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc
        stops, even if that pivot point is in their defending end zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        7.11. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes
        out-of-bounds without contacting an offensive player, the thrower must
        establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line,
        or the nearest location in the central zone if that pivot point would be
        in their defending end zone.
        <ul>
          <li>
            7.11.1. If the disc does contact an offensive player before it
            becomes out-of-bounds the thrower must establish a pivot point where
            the disc first crossed the perimeter line, even if that pivot point
            is in their defending end zone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        7.12. If the disc contacts the out-of-bounds area without first touching
        the playing field or an offensive player, the thrower may establish a
        pivot point either at the brick mark closest to their defending end
        zone, or at the location on the central zone closest to where the disc
        went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8). The binding brick option must be
        signalled before the disc is picked up, by any offensive player fully
        extending one arm overhead and calling "brick".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. State of Play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        8.1. Play is 'dead', and no turnover is possible:
        <ul>
          <li>
            8.1.1. After the start of a point, until the pull is released;
          </li>
          <li>
            8.1.2. When the disc must be carried to the pivot location after the
            pull or after a turnover, until a pivot point is established;
          </li>
          <li>
            8.1.3. After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage,
            until the disc is checked in; or
          </li>
          <li>
            8.1.4. After a disc hits the ground, until possession is established
            by the appropriate team.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.1.5. Players are allowed to move during dead play (unless
            specified otherwise).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>8.2. Play that is not dead is "live".</li>
      <li>
        8.3. The thrower may not transfer possession of the disc during dead
        play to another player.
      </li>
      <li>
        8.4. Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after
        it has hit the ground.
        <ul>
          <li>
            8.4.1. If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly
            alters the disc’s position, the opposition may request that the
            pivot point be established at the location where the disc was
            contacted.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        8.5. After a turnover, and after the pull, an offensive player must move
        at walking pace or faster to directly retrieve the disc and establish a
        pivot point.
        <ul>
          <li>
            8.5.1. In addition to 8.5, after a turnover the offence must put the
            disc into play within the following time limits, if the disc did not
            become out-of-bounds, and the disc's location is:
            <ul>
              <li>
                8.5.1.1. in the Central Zone– within ten (10) seconds of the
                disc coming to rest.
              </li>
              <li>
                8.5.1.2. in an end zone – within twenty (20) seconds of the disc
                coming to rest.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            8.5.2. If the offence breaches 8.5, or 8.5.1, the defence may give a
            verbal warning (“Delay of Game” or using a Pre Stall) or may call a
            “Violation”.
            <ul>
              <li>
                8.5.2.1. If, after a warning, the offence continues to breach
                8.5, or 8.5.1, then 9.3.1 does not apply and the marker may
                commence the stall count.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Stall Count</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        9.1. The marker administers a stall count on the thrower by announcing
        “Stalling” and then counting from one (1) to ten (10). The interval
        between the start of each number in the stall count must be at least one
        (1) second.
      </li>
      <li>9.2. The stall count must be clearly communicated to the thrower.</li>
      <li>
        9.3. The marker may only start and continue a stall count when:
        <ul>
          <li>
            9.3.1. Play is live, or until a pivot is established after a
            turnover;
          </li>
          <li>
            9.3.2. They are within three (3) metres of the thrower's pivot;
          </li>
          <li>9.3.3. All defenders are legally positioned (Section 18.1).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        9.4. If the marker moves beyond the appropriate three (3) metre radius,
        or a different player becomes the marker, the stall count must be
        restarted at "Stalling one (1)".
      </li>
      <li>
        9.5. After a stoppage in play the stall count is resumed as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            9.5.1. After an accepted breach by the defence the stall count
            restarts at "Stalling one (1)".
          </li>
          <li>
            9.5.2. After an accepted breach by the offence the stall count
            restarts at maximum nine (9).
          </li>
          <li>
            9.5.3. After a contested stall-out the stall count restarts at
            "Stalling eight (8)".
          </li>
          <li>
            9.5.4. After all other calls, including "pick", the stall count
            restarts at maximum six (6). However:
            <ul>
              <li>
                9.5.4.1. If there is a call involving the thrower, and a
                separate receiving breach, and the disc is returned to the
                thrower, the stall count is resumed based on the outcome of the
                call involving the thrower.
              </li>
              <li>
                9.5.4.2. If there is a violation called related to The Check
                (Section 10), the stall count resumes at the same count that was
                determined prior to that violation.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>10. The Check</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        10.1. Whenever play stops during a point for a foul, violation,
        contested turnover, specified turnover, contested goal, stoppage,
        discussion, or at the completion of a time-out, play must restart as
        quickly as possible with a check. The check may only be delayed for the
        discussion of a call.
      </li>
      <li>
        10.2. Player positioning after a call (except in the case of a time-out,
        and unless specified otherwise):
        <ul>
          <li>
            10.2.1. If play stops before a pass is thrown, all players must
            return to the location they held when the call was made.
          </li>
          <li>
            10.2.2. If play stops after a pass is thrown, then:
            <ul>
              <li>
                10.2.2.1. if the disc is returned to the thrower, all players
                must return to the location they held when the thrower released
                the disc, or the time of the call, whichever is earlier.
              </li>
              <li>
                10.2.2.2. if the result of the play stands all players must
                return to the location they held when either a player
                established possession, or the disc hit the ground.
              </li>
              <li>
                10.2.2.3. if a player other than the thrower gains possession as
                a result of an accepted breach, all players must return to the
                location they held when the breach occurred.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            10.2.3. All players must remain stationary in that location until
            the disc is checked in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        10.3. Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to fix faulty
        equipment (“equipment”), but active play may not be stopped for this
        purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
        10.4. Prior to the check the person checking the disc in, and the
        nearest opposition player, must verify that their own team-mates are
        ready, and positioned as per 10.2.
      </li>
      <li>
        10.5. If there is an unnecessary delay in checking the disc in, the
        opposition may give a warning (“Delay of Game”). If the delay continues,
        the team that gave the warning may check the disc in by calling “Disc
        In”, without verification from the opposition, but only if the team
        checking the disc in are all stationary, and positioned as per 10.2.
      </li>
      <li>
        10.6. To restart play with a check:
        <ul>
          <li>
            10.6.1. when the thrower has the disc:
            <ul>
              <li>
                10.6.1.1. if there is a defender within reach, the defender must
                touch the disc.
              </li>
              <li>
                10.6.1.2. if there is not a defender within reach, the thrower
                must touch the disc to the ground and may call “Disc In”.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            10.6.2. when the disc is on the ground, the defender nearest to the
            disc must call “Disc In”.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        10.7. A player may call a violation regarding the check if an opponent:
        <ul>
          <li>
            10.7.1. attempts a pass without an appropriate check as per 10.6; or
          </li>
          <li>
            10.7.2. restarts play without verification from their nearest
            opposition player; or
          </li>
          <li>10.7.3. is moving immediately prior to the check; or</li>
          <li>10.7.4. was not in the appropriate position.</li>
          <li>
            10.7.5. After this violation call any pass does not count regardless
            of whether it is complete or incomplete, and possession reverts back
            to the thrower (unless 16.3 applies).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>11. Out-of-Bounds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        11.1. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not
        part of the playing field and are out-of-bounds. All non-players are
        part of the out-of-bounds area.
      </li>
      <li>
        11.2. The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not
        in-bounds and everything in contact with it, except for defensive
        players, who are always considered “in-bounds”.
      </li>
      <li>
        11.3. An offensive player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds.
        <ul>
          <li>
            11.3.1. An airborne player retains their in-bounds/out-of-bounds
            status until that player contacts the playing field or the
            out-of-bounds area.
          </li>
          <li>
            11.3.2. A player who has caught the disc, who contacts the playing
            field and then contacts an out-of-bounds area, is still considered
            in-bounds, as long as they maintain the catch until they establish
            possession.
            <ul>
              <li>
                11.3.2.1. If they leave the playing field, they must establish a
                pivot point at the location on the playing field where they
                crossed the perimeter line (unless 14.3 is in effect).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            11.3.3. A thrower who contacts an out-of-bounds area is considered
            in-bounds until they make a pass.
          </li>
          <li>
            11.3.4. Contact between players does not confer the state of being
            in- or out-of-bounds from one to another.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        11.4. The following are out-of-bounds turnovers, and no catch is deemed
        to have occurred:
        <ul>
          <li>
            11.4.1. any part of an offensive receiver is out-of-bounds when they
            contact the disc; or any part of an offensive receiver is
            out-of-bounds when they contact the disc;
          </li>
          <li>
            11.4.2. after catching the disc while airborne, an offensive
            receiver’s first contact is out-of-bounds while still in contact
            with the disc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        11.5. A disc is in-bounds once play is live, or when play starts or
        restarts.
      </li>
      <li>
        11.6. A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the
        out-of-bounds area or contacts an out-of-bounds offensive player. A disc
        that has been caught by an offensive player has the same
        in/out-of-bounds status as that player. If the disc is simultaneously
        caught by more than one offensive player, one of them being
        out-of-bounds, the disc is out-of-bounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        11.7. The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the
        playing field, and players may go out-of-bounds to make a play on the
        disc.
      </li>
      <li>
        11.8. The place where a disc went out-of-bounds is the location where,
        prior to contacting an out-of-bounds area or player, the disc was most
        recently:
        <ul>
          <li>11.8.1. partly or wholly over the playing field; or</li>
          <li>11.8.2. contacted by an in-bounds player.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        11.9. If the disc is out-of-bounds and more than three (3) metres from
        the pivot location, non-players may retrieve the disc. The thrower must
        carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the playing field.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Receivers and Positioning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        12.1. A “catch” occurs when a player has a non-spinning disc trapped
        between at least two body parts. A catch can enable a player to
        establish possession of the disc.
        <ul>
          <li>
            12.1.1. If the player fails to maintain the catch due to subsequent
            ground contact related to the catch, or contact related to the catch
            with a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition player,
            possession is deemed to have not occurred.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        12.2. After establishing possession, that player becomes the thrower.
      </li>
      <li>
        12.3. If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously,
        the offence retains possession.
      </li>
      <li>
        12.4. A player in an established position is entitled to remain in that
        position and must not be contacted by an opposing player.
      </li>
      <li>
        12.5. Every player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not
        occupied by any opposing player, provided that they do not initiate
        contact in taking such a position, and are not moving in a reckless or
        dangerously aggressive manner.
        <ul>
          <li>
            12.5.1. However, when the disc is in the air, a player may not move
            in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied
            path to make a play on the disc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        12.6. All players must attempt to avoid contact with other players, and
        there is no situation where a player may justify initiating contact.
        This includes avoiding initiating contact with a stationary opponent, or
        an opponent’s expected position based on their established speed and
        direction. 'Making a play for the disc' is not a valid excuse for
        initiating contact with other players.
        <ul>
          <li>
            12.6.1. If a player is not reasonably certain that they will be able
            to make a legal play at the disc before an opponent who is moving in
            a legal manner, they must adjust their movements to avoid initiating
            contact. If that adjustment is made, the result of the play still
            stands.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        12.7. The player who initiates contact is deemed to be the player who:
        <ul>
          <li>
            12.7.1. arrived at the point of contact after the opponent had
            already established a legitimate position at that point (either a
            stationary or moving opponent), or
          </li>
          <li>
            12.7.2. adjusted their movements in a way that created unavoidable
            contact with an opponent moving in a legal manner, when taking into
            account all players’ established position, speed, and direction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        12.8. Some minor contact may occur as two or more players move towards a
        single point simultaneously. Minor contact should be minimized but is
        not considered a foul.
      </li>
      <li>
        12.9. Players may not use their arms or legs to obstruct the movement of
        opposing players.
      </li>
      <li>
        12.10. No player may physically assist the movement of another player,
        nor use an item of equipment or object to assist in contacting the disc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Turnovers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        13.1. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to
        the other occurs when:
        <ul>
          <li>
            13.1.1. the disc contacts the ground while it is not in the
            possession of an offensive player (a “down”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.1.1.1. however it is not “down” if a receiver catches a pass
            before the disc contacts the ground, and maintains the catch while
            the disc is in contact with the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            13.1.2. a defensive player establishes possession of a pass (an
            “interception”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.1.3. the disc becomes out-of-bounds (an “out-of-bounds” or
            "out"); or
          </li>
          <li>
            13.1.4. during the pull, the offence touches the disc before it hits
            the ground, and subsequently fails to establish possession of the
            disc (a “dropped pull”).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.2. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to
        the other, and results in a stoppage of play, occurs when:
        <ul>
          <li>13.2.1. there is an accepted offensive receiving foul;</li>
          <li>
            13.2.2. the thrower has not released the disc before the marker
            first starts to say the word “ten” in the stall count (a
            “stall-out”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.2.3. the disc is intentionally transferred from one offensive
            player to another without ever being completely untouched by both
            players (a “hand-over”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.2.4. the thrower intentionally deflects a pass to themselves off
            another player (a “deflection”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.2.5. in attempting a pass, the thrower catches the disc after
            release prior to the disc being contacted by another player (a
            “self-catch”);
          </li>
          <li>
            13.2.6. an offensive player intentionally assists a team-mate’s
            movement to catch a pass; or
          </li>
          <li>
            13.2.7. an offensive player uses an item of equipment or object to
            assist in catching a pass.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.3. If a player determines a turnover has occurred they must make the
        appropriate call immediately. If the opposition disagrees they may call
        "contest" and play must stop. If, after discussion, players cannot agree
        or it is unclear what occurred in the play, the disc must be returned to
        the last non-disputed thrower.
      </li>
      <li>
        13.4. After a “stall-out” call:
        <ul>
          <li>
            13.4.1. If the thrower still has possession of the disc, but they
            believe a fast count occurred in such a manner that they did not
            have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out,
            the play is treated as either an accepted defensive breach (9.5.1)
            or a contested stall-out (9.5.3).
          </li>
          <li>
            13.4.2. If the thrower made a completed pass, the thrower can
            contest if they believe it was not a “stall-out”, or there was a
            fast count immediately prior to the “stall-out”.
          </li>
          <li>
            13.4.3. If the thrower contests a stall-out but also attempts a
            pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands and play
            restarts with a check.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.5. Any offensive player may take possession of the disc after a
        turnover, except:
        <ul>
          <li>
            13.5.1. after an “interception” turnover, in which case the player
            who made the interception must maintain possession;
          </li>
          <li>
            13.5.2. after an offensive receiving foul, in which case the fouled
            player must take possession.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.6. If the player in possession after a turnover, or after a pull that
        has already hit the ground, intentionally drops the disc, places the
        disc on the ground, or transfers possession of the disc, they must
        re-establish possession and restart play with a check.
      </li>
      <li>
        13.7. After a turnover, the turnover location is where:
        <ul>
          <li>
            13.7.1. the disc has come to a stop or is picked up by an offensive
            player;
          </li>
          <li>13.7.2. the intercepting player stops;</li>
          <li>
            13.7.3. the thrower was located at the time of the call, in the case
            of 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 13.2.4, 13.2.5;
          </li>
          <li>
            13.7.4. the offensive player was located, in the case of 13.2.6 and
            13.2.7;
          </li>
          <li>13.7.5. the accepted offensive receiving foul occurred.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.8. If the turnover location is out-of-bounds, or the disc touched an
        out-of-bounds area after the turnover occurred, the thrower must
        establish a pivot point at the location on the central zone nearest to
        where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8).
      </li>
      <li>
        13.8.1. If 13.8 does not apply, a pivot point must be established
        according to 13.9, 13.10, or 13.11.
      </li>
      <li>
        13.9. If the turnover location is in the central zone, the thrower must
        establish a pivot point at that location.
      </li>
      <li>
        13.10. If the turnover location is in the offence’s attacking end zone,
        the thrower must establish a pivot point at the nearest location on the
        goal line.
      </li>
      <li>
        13.11. If the turnover location is in the offence’s defending end zone,
        the thrower may choose where to establish a pivot point:
        <ul>
          <li>
            13.11.1. at the turnover location, by staying at the turnover
            location or faking a pass;
          </li>
          <li>
            13.11.2. at the nearest location on the goal line to the turnover
            location, by moving from the turnover location.
          </li>
          <li>
            13.11.2.1. The intended thrower, before picking up the disc, may
            signal the goal line option by fully extending one arm above their
            head.
          </li>
          <li>
            13.11.3. Immediate movement, staying at the turnover location,
            faking a pass, or signaling the goal line option determines where to
            establish a pivot point and cannot be reversed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        13.12. If, after an accepted turnover, play has continued unknowingly,
        play stops and the disc is returned to the turnover location, players
        resume their positions at the time the turnover occurred and play
        restarts with a check.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        14.1. A goal is scored if an in-bounds player catches a legal pass and:
        <ul>
          <li>
            14.1.1. All their ground contacts are entirely within their
            attacking end zone, or for an airborne player, all of their first
            simultaneous points of ground contact after catching the disc are
            entirely within their attacking end zone.
          </li>
          <li>
            14.1.2. They subsequently establish possession of the disc, and
            maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the
            catch (note 12.1, 12.1.1).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        14.2. If a player believes a goal has been scored, they may call “goal”
        and play stops. After a contested or retracted goal call, play must
        restart with a check and the call is deemed to have been made when the
        player established possession.
      </li>
      <li>
        14.3. If a player in possession of the disc ends up with their selected
        pivot point behind the attacking goal line without scoring a goal
        according to 14.1, the player must establish a pivot point at the
        nearest location on the goal line.
      </li>
      <li>
        14.4. The time at which a goal is deemed to have been scored is when the
        player established possession.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15. Calling Fouls, Infractions and Viulations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        15.1. A breach of the rules due to non-minor contact between two or more
        opposing players is a foul.
        <ul>
          <li>
            15.1.1. A player intentionally initiating minor contact is still a
            breach of the rules, but is to be treated as a violation, and not a
            foul.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        15.2. A breach of the rules regarding a Marking or Travel breach is an
        infraction. Infractions do not stop play.
      </li>
      <li>15.3. Every other breach of the rules is a violation.</li>
      <li>15.4. Only the player fouled may claim a foul, by calling “Foul”.</li>
      <li>
        15.5. In general only the thrower may claim an infraction, by calling
        the specific name of the infraction.
        <ul>
          <li>
            15.5.1. However any offensive player may call a double team, and any
            defensive player may call a travel infraction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        15.6. Any opposing player may claim a violation, by calling the specific
        name of the violation or "Violation", unless specified otherwise by the
        particular rule.
      </li>
      <li>
        15.7. When a foul or violation call is made that stops play, players
        must stop play by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage as soon
        as they are aware of the call and all players should echo calls on the
        field. If play has stopped for a discussion without any call having been
        made, a call is deemed to have been made when the discussion started.
      </li>
      <li>
        15.8. Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised.
      </li>
      <li>
        15.9. After a player initiates a stoppage incorrectly, including after
        mishearing a call, not knowing the rules, or not making the call
        immediately:
        <ul>
          <li>
            15.9.1. If the opposition gains or retains possession, any
            subsequent play stands.
          </li>
          <li>
            15.9.2. If the opposition does not gain or retain possession, the
            disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower, unless 16.3
            applies. The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been
            caused by the player who initiated the stoppage incorrectly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        15.10. If the player against whom the foul, infraction, or violation has
        been called disagrees that it occurred, or does not think it is a
        correct call, they may call “Contest”.
      </li>
      <li>
        15.11. If a player making any call subsequently determines that their
        call was incorrect, they can retract the call, by calling "Retracted".
        The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by that
        player.
      </li>
      <li>
        15.12. If multiple breaches occur on the same play or before play stops,
        the outcomes should be resolved in reverse sequence (latest breach
        first, earliest breach last).
      </li>
      <li>
        15.13. Players are encouraged to use the WFDF Hand Signals to
        communicate all calls.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>16. Continuation after a Call</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        16.1. Whenever a foul or violation call is made, or a player attempts to
        stop play in any way, play stops immediately and no turnover is possible
        (unless in situations specified in 15.9, 16.2, and 16.3).
      </li>
      <li>
        16.2. If a foul or violation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            16.2.1. is called against the thrower and the thrower attempts a
            pass, or
          </li>
          <li>
            16.2.2. is called by the thrower during the act of throwing, or
          </li>
          <li>16.2.3. is called or occurs when the disc is in the air,</li>
          <li>
            Then play continues until possession has been established.
            <ul>
              <li>
                16.2.4. Once possession has been established:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    16.2.4.1. If the team that called the foul or violation
                    gains or retains possession as a result of the pass, the
                    play stands. Play can continue without a stoppage if the
                    player who made the foul or violation call makes a “Play on”
                    call as soon as possible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    16.2.4.2. If the team that called the foul or violation does
                    not gain or retain possession as a result of the pass, play
                    must be stopped.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    16.2.4.2.1. If the team that called the foul or violation
                    believes that possession has been affected by the foul or
                    violation, the disc will be returned to the thrower for a
                    check (unless the specific rule says otherwise).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        16.3. Regardless of when any call is made, if the players involved from
        both teams agree that the event or call did not affect the outcome, the
        play stands. This rule is not superseded by any other rule.
        <ul>
          <li>16.3.1. If the play resulted in a goal, the goal stands.</li>
          <li>
            16.3.2. If the play did not result in a goal, the affected players
            may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the event or call
            and restart play with a check.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>17. Fouls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        17.1. Dangerous Play:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.1.1. Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of
            fellow players, or posing significant risk of injury to fellow
            players, or other dangerously aggressive behaviours, are considered
            dangerous play and must be treated as a foul, regardless of whether
            or when contact occurs. This rule is not superseded by any other
            foul rule. If the dangerous play call is accepted, this must be
            treated as the most relevant foul from Section 17.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.2. Receiving Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.2.1. A Receiving Foul occurs when a player initiates non-minor
            contact with an opponent before, while, or directly after, either
            player makes a play on the disc
          </li>
          <li>
            17.2.1.1. Contact with an opponent’s arms or hands, that occurs
            after the disc has been caught, or after the opponent can no longer
            make a play on the disc, is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but
            should be avoided (excluding contact related to Section 17.1 and
            17.3).
          </li>
          <li>
            17.2.2. After an accepted receiving foul the fouled player gains
            possession at the location of the breach, even if that location is
            in an end zone, and play restarts with a check. If, after the check,
            14.3 applies, the stall count can not be started until a pivot point
            is established at the nearest location on the goal line. If the foul
            is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.3. Strip Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.3.1. A Strip Foul occurs when an opponent fouls a player and that
            causes the player to drop a disc they caught or to lose possession
            of the disc.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.3.2. If the reception would have otherwise been a goal, and the
            foul is uncontested, a goal is awarded.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.4. Blocking Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.4.1. A Blocking Foul occurs when a player takes a position that
            an opponent moving in a legal manner will be unable to avoid, taking
            into account the opponents expected position based on their
            established speed and direction, and non-minor contact results. This
            is to be treated as either a receiving foul or an indirect foul,
            whichever is applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.5. Force-out Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.5.1. A Force-out Foul occurs when a receiver is in the process of
            establishing possession of the disc, and is fouled by a defensive
            player before establishing possession, and the contact caused the
            receiver:
          </li>
          <li>17.5.1.1. to become out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds; or</li>
          <li>
            17.5.1.2. to catch the disc in the central zone instead of their
            attacking end zone.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.5.2. If the receiver would have caught the disc in their
            attacking end zone, it is a goal;
          </li>
          <li>
            17.5.3. If the force-out foul is contested, the disc is returned to
            the thrower if the receiver became out-of-bounds, otherwise the disc
            stays with the receiver.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.6. Defensive Throwing (Marking) Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>17.6.1. A Defensive Throwing Foul occurs when:</li>
          <li>
            17.6.1.1. A defensive player is illegally positioned (Section 18.1),
            and there is non-minor contact between the illegally positioned
            defensive player and the thrower; or
          </li>
          <li>
            17.6.1.2. A defensive player initiates non-minor contact with the
            thrower, or there is non-minor contact resulting from the thrower
            and the defender both vying for the same unoccupied position, prior
            to the release.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.6.1.3. If a Defensive Throwing Foul occurs prior to the thrower
            releasing the disc and not during the throwing motion, the thrower
            may choose to call a contact infraction, by calling “Contact”. After
            a contact infraction that is not contested, play does not stop and
            the marker must resume the stall count at one (1).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.7. Offensive Throwing (Thrower) Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.7.1. An Offensive Throwing Foul occurs when the thrower is solely
            responsible for initiating non-minor contact with a defensive player
            who is in a legal position.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.7.2. Contact occurring during the thrower's follow through is not
            a sufficient basis for a foul, but should be avoided.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.8. Indirect Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.8.1. An Indirect Foul occurs when there is non-minor contact
            between a receiver and a defensive player that does not directly
            affect an attempt to make a play on the disc.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.8.2. If the foul is accepted the fouled player may make up any
            positional disadvantage caused by the foul.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        17.9. Offsetting Fouls:
        <ul>
          <li>
            17.9.1. If accepted fouls are called by offensive and defensive
            players on the same play, these are offsetting fouls, and the disc
            must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.9.2. If there is non-minor contact that is caused by two or more
            opposing players moving towards a single point simultaneously, this
            must be treated as offsetting fouls.
          </li>
          <li>
            17.9.2.1. However if this occurs after the disc has been caught, or
            after the relevant player/s involved can no longer make a play on
            the disc, this must be treated as an Indirect Foul (excluding
            contact related to Section 17.1).

    <h2>18. Infractions and Viulations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        18.1. Marking Infractions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            18.1.1. Marking infractions include the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.1.1.1. “Fast Count” – the marker:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    18.1.1.1.1. starts or continues the stall count illegally,
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    18.1.1.1.2. does not start or restart the stall count with
                    the word “Stalling”,
                  </li>
                  <li>18.1.1.1.3. counts in less than one second intervals,</li>
                  <li>
                    18.1.1.1.4. does not correctly reduce or reset the stall
                    count when required, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    18.1.1.1.5. does not start the stall count from the correct
                    number.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                18.1.1.2. “Straddle” – a line between a defensive player’s feet
                comes within one disc diameter of the thrower’s pivot point
              </li>
              <li>
                18.1.1.3. “Disc Space” – any part of a defensive player is less
                than one disc diameter away from the torso of the thrower.
                However, if this situation is caused solely by movement of the
                thrower, it is not an infraction.
              </li>
              <li>
                18.1.1.4. “Wrapping” – a line between a defensive player’s hands
                or arms comes within one disc diameter of the thrower’s torso,
                or any part of the defensive player’s body is above the
                thrower’s pivot point. However, if this situation is caused
                solely by movement of the thrower, it is not an infraction.
              </li>
              <li>
                18.1.1.5. "Double Team" –a defensive player other than the
                marker is within three (3) metres of the thrower's pivot point
                without also guarding another offensive player. However, merely
                running across this area is not a double team
              </li>
              <li>
                18.1.1.6. “Vision” - a defensive player uses any part of their
                body to intentionally obstruct the thrower’s vision.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.1.2. A marking infraction may be contested by the defence, in
            which case play stops.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.1.3 After all marking infractions listed in 18.1.1. that are not
            contested, the marker must resume the stall count with the number
            last fully uttered before the call, minus one (1).
          </li>
          <li>
            18.1.4 The marker may not resume counting until any illegal
            positioning has been corrected. To do otherwise is a subsequent
            marking infraction.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.1.5 Instead of calling a marking infraction, the thrower may call
            a marking violation and stop play if;
            <ul>
              <li>18.1.5.1. the stall count is not corrected</li>
              <li>18.1.5.2. there is no stall count,</li>
              <li>18.1.5.3. there is an egregious marking infraction, or,</li>
              <li>
                18.1.5.4. there is a pattern of repeated marking infractions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.1.6. If a marking infraction, or a marking violation, is called
            and the thrower also attempts a pass before, during or after the
            call, the call has no consequences (unless 18.1.2.1 applies) and if
            the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        18.2. “Travel” Infractions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            18.2.1. The thrower may attempt a pass at any time as long as they
            are entirely in-bounds or have established an in-bounds pivot point.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.2.1.1. they do not change direction or increase speed until
            they release the pass; and
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.2.1.2. a maximum of two additional points of contact with the
            ground are made after the catch and before they release the pass.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.3. The thrower may move in any direction (pivot) only by
            establishing a “pivot point”, which is a specific point on the
            ground with which one part of their body remains in constant contact
            until the disc is thrown.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.4. A thrower who is not standing can use any part of their body
            as the pivot point.
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.2.4.1. If they stand up it is not a travel, but only if a
                pivot point is established at the same location.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.5. A travel infraction occurs if:
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.2.5.1. the thrower establishes a pivot point at an incorrect
                location, including by not reducing speed as quickly as possible
                after a catch, or changing direction after a catch;
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.5.2. the thrower releases a pass in breach of 18.2.2.1;
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.5.3. anytime the thrower must move to a specified location,
                the thrower does not establish a pivot point before a wind-up or
                throwing action begins;
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.5.4. the thrower fails to keep the established pivot point
                until releasing the disc;
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.5.5. a player intentionally bobbles, fumbles or delays the
                disc to themselves, for the sole purpose of moving in a specific
                direction.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.6. After an accepted travel infraction is called ("travel"),
            play does not stop.
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.2.6.1. The thrower establishes a pivot point at the correct
                location, as indicated by the player who called the travel. This
                must occur without delay from either player involved.
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.6.2. Any stall count is paused, and the thrower may not
                throw the disc, until a pivot point is established at the
                correct location.
              </li>
              <li>
                18.2.6.3. The marker does not need to say “Stalling” before
                resuming the stall count.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.7. If, after a travel infraction but before correcting the
            pivot point, the thrower throws a completed pass, the defensive team
            may call a travel violation. Play stops and the disc is returned to
            the thrower. The thrower must return to the location occupied at the
            time of the infraction. Play must restart with a check.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.8. If, after a travel infraction, the thrower throws an
            incomplete pass, play continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.2.9. After a contested travel infraction where the thrower has
            not released the disc, play stops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        18.3. “Pick” Violations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            18.3.1. If a defensive player is guarding one offensive player and
            they are prevented from moving towards/with that player by another
            player, that defensive player may call “Pick”. However, it is not a
            pick if both the player being guarded and the obstructing player are
            making a play on the disc.
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.3.1.1. Prior to making the "Pick" call, the defender may
                delay the call up to two (2) seconds to determine if the
                obstruction will affect the play.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            18.3.2. If play has stopped, the obstructed player may move to the
            agreed position they would have otherwise occupied if the
            obstruction had not occurred, unless specified otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            18.3.3. All players should take reasonable efforts to avoid the
            occurrence of picks.
            <ul>
              <li>
                18.3.3.1. During any stoppage, opposing players may agree to
                slightly adjust their locations to avoid potential picks.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>19. Safety Stoppages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        19.1. Injury Stoppage
        <ul>
          <li>
            19.1.1. An injury stoppage, “Injury”, may be called by the injured
            player, or by any player on the injured player’s team.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.1.2. If the injury was not caused by an opponent, the player must
            choose either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a
            time-out.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.1.3. If the injury was caused by an opponent the player may
            choose to stay or to be substituted.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.1.4. If the injured player had established possession of the
            disc, and the player has dropped the disc due to the injury, that
            player retains possession of the disc.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.1.5. The injury stoppage is considered to have been called at the
            time of the injury, unless the injured player chooses to continue
            play before the stoppage is called.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.1.6. If the disc was in the air when the injury stoppage was
            called, play continues until either a player establishes possesion,
            or the disc hits the ground. If the injury is not the result of a
            foul by an opponent, the completion or turnover stands, and play
            restarts there after the stoppage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        19.2. Technical Stoppage
        <ul>
          <li>
            19.2.1. Any player who recognises a condition that endangers
            players, including if a player has an open or bleeding wound, should
            call a technical stoppage by calling “technical” or “stop”. Play
            must stop immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.2.1.1. A team-mate, coach, or designated official, should
            actively alert players to any condition that endangers players.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.2.1.2. A player who has an issue regarding an open or bleeding
            wound has seventy (70) seconds to effectively address the issue. If
            they need additional time to address the issue, they must choose
            either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a
            time-out.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.2.2. The thrower may call a technical stoppage during play to
            replace a severely damaged disc.
          </li>
          <li>
            19.2.3. After a technical stoppage called while the disc is in the
            air, or if play has continued unknowingly:
            <ul>
              <li>
                19.2.3.1. If the call or issue did not affect play, the
                completion or turnover stands, and play restarts there;
              </li>
              <li>
                19.2.3.2. If the call or issue did affect the play, the disc
                goes back to the thrower.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        19.3. If a player is substituted after an injury, or due to illegal or
        faulty equipment, the opposing team may also choose to substitute one
        player.
        <ul>
          <li>
            19.3.1. Substitute players take on the full state (location,
            possession, stall count etc) of the player they are substituting and
            may make a call on their behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>20. Time-Outs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        20.1. The player calling a time-out must form a "T" with their hands, or
        with one hand and the disc, and should call "time-out" to opposition
        players.
      </li>
      <li>
        20.2. After the start of a point and before both teams have signalled
        readiness, a player from either team may call a time-out. The time-out
        extends the time between the start of the point and subsequent pull by
        seventy-five (75) seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        20.3. After the pull only a thrower with possession of the disc may call
        a time-out. The time-out starts when the “T” is formed, and lasts
        seventy-five (75) seconds. After such a time-out:
        <ul>
          <li>20.3.1. Substitutions are not allowed, except for injury.</li>
          <li>20.3.2. Play is restarted at the pivot location.</li>
          <li>20.3.3. The thrower must remain the same.</li>
          <li>
            20.3.4. All other offensive players must establish a stationary
            position, at any location.
          </li>
          <li>
            20.3.5. Once the offensive players have selected positions,
            defensive players must then establish a stationary position, at any
            location.
          </li>
          <li>
            20.3.6. The stall count restarts at maximum nine (9). However, if
            the marker has been switched, the stall count restarts at “Stalling
            one (1)”.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        20.4. If the thrower attempts to call a time-out while play is live and
        when their team has no remaining time-outs, play is stopped. The marker
        must add two (2) seconds to the stall count they would have restarted
        play on before restarting play with a check. If this results in a stall
        count of ten (10) or above, this is a "stall-out" turnover.
      </li>
    </ul>
